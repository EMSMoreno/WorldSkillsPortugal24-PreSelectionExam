Worldskills Portugal Pre-Selection Test that took 1st place and took place in May 2024.

- The theme of the test was Skillian Cinemas and the objective was to create a CRUD for the different entities, not only at the frontend level (client-side and UX/UI) but also at the backend level (server-side, with respective bases of data created with SQL Server), thus creating a robust full-stack application.
