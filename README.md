# About This Project
This project was developed for the WorldSkills Portugal Pre-Selection Test, where it achieved 1st place and took place in May 2024.

The theme of the test was Skillian Cinemas, and the objective was to create a CRUD for different entities, not only at the frontend level (client-side and UX/UI) but also at the backend level (server-side, with respective databases created with SQL Server), thus creating a robust full-stack application.
